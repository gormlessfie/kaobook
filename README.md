# README

This is an application that attempts to recreate the core functions of Facebook.
The core features of this application is to be able to add friends and create posts
which are shared amongst your friends.

The posts can be liked and commented on.

I am using this application to get a better understanding of notifications, deeply
associated models, mailer, and ActiveStorage.
